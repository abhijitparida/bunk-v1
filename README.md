ITER Bunk
=========

Studying in ITER? Tired of trying to figure out if you can bunk a class or not? Well, not anymore. This app will tell you exactly how many classes you can bunk or how many classes you need to maintain your attendance. Your attendance is fetched automatically, so all you have to do is enter your registration number and check your attendance.
